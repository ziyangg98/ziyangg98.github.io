My research centers on **survival analysis** and its modern applications in distributed data environments. Specifically, I focus on:

- **Federated Survival Analysis**: Developing privacy-preserving methods for analyzing time-to-event data across multiple institutions without sharing raw data
- **Transfer Learning for Survival Models**: Leveraging knowledge from related domains to improve survival predictions in data-scarce scenarios
